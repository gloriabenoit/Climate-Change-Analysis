# Data science of climate change
December 2023 (M1 BI)

## Introduction

This project aims to quantify and characterize climate change, by finding data sources and reproducing scientific graphs.
The project is being carried out in two stages: analysis of atmospheric CO2, followed by analysis of temperature trends.

This was done with my Python teacher, Pierre Poulain, who has made a repository of his own following our collaboration.

[![CO2-concentration](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=pierrepo&repo=CO2-concentration&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/pierrepo/CO2-concentration)

## Setup

To install the algorithm and its dependencies, you need to perform the following steps:

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gloriabenoit/Climate-Change-Analysis.git

cd Climate-Change-Analysis
```

### Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

### Create a Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Activate the Conda environment

```bash
conda activate climate-change-analysis
```

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook src/ClimateChange_Analysis.ipynb
```
